2. Where (what line numbers) have you set the breakpoints? 

3. What is the value of the named constant MIN_FAHRENHEIT and the variable tempScaleStr displayed in the Variables window? 

	MIN_FAHRENHEIT: 
	
	tempScaleStr:

4. Answer the following questions:

  a) Does the first if statement display the error message correctly? 
  b) What is the problem?
  c) How would you fix the program so it terminates when the user enters a Fahrenheit temperature less than the possible minimum temperature?

5. Answer the following questions:

  b) How will you change it?

6. What is the value of the expression you just selected in the Watch window?

7. Answer the following questions:

  a) Does the program compute the correct temperature in Rankine degrees?  In Reamur degrees?
  b) Does the program assign the correct value for the variable tempScaleStr?
